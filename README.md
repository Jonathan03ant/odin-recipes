# odin-recipes

In this project, we will try to create a very simple website that shows you how to make some of your favorite dishes.

This website has a root file, called indexhtml which contains the code for the actual website.

in addition to index.html, we have individual webpages under file "recipes". 

This file contains a list of webpages with recipies, and another img directory which saves the images we will be using to create the website.
